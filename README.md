# League Narrative Generator

Our goal is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to help create authentic League of Legends narratives. Specifically, weâ€™re fine-tuning GPT-2, a powerful language model, to generate content that feels like it belongs in the world of Runeterra. Our core objectives are:

- Develop a specialized language model for League of Legends narrative generation that understands the unique vocabulary, themes, and narrative styles of the LoL universe.
- Create contextually appropriate content consistent with character personalities, ensuring that an Ashe story feels distinctly different from a Jinx story, not just in subject matter but in tone and voice.
- Build a tool for efficient lore-consistent content creation that can assist writers, developers, and fans in producing narratives that remain true to the established universe.
