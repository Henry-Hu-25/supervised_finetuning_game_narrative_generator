# Fine-tuning GPT 2: League of Legends Narrative Generator

I'm fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate content that feels like it belongs in the world of Runeterra (League of Legends). My core objectives are:

- Develop a specialized language model for League of Legends narrative generation that understands the unique vocabulary, themes, and narrative styles of the LoL universe.
- Create contextually appropriate content consistent with character personalities, ensuring that an Ashe story feels distinctly different from a Jinx story.
- Build a tool for efficient lore-consistent content creation that can assist writers, developers, and fans in producing narratives that remain true to the established universe.
